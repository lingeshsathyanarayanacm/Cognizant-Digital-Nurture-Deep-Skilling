# Cognizant Digital Nurture â€“ Deep Skilling Program

As part of Cognizant's Deep Skilling program, I successfully completed extensive hands-on training in core software engineering practices and modern enterprise development using Java and Spring Boot. Below is a summary of the technologies, tools, and methodologies I mastered during the program:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts & Principles
- **Design Principles & Patterns**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using JUnit 5 and Mockito
- **Logging** with SLF4J

---

## ðŸ”¹ Backend Development
- **Spring Core** and **Dependency Injection**
- **Spring Boot 3** for rapid application development
- **Spring Data JPA** with Hibernate for ORM
- **Spring REST** for creating robust RESTful APIs

---

## ðŸ”¹ Database Technologies
- **PL/SQL Programming**
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** integration with Spring Boot (via JPA)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Development Tools & Build Management
- **Maven** for build automation and dependency management

---

## ðŸ”¹ Computer Science Fundamentals
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - Focused on problem-solving and optimizing code
  - Learned real-world applications in backend logic and APIs

---

## ðŸ’¼ Outcome
This program empowered me with industry-relevant backend development skills, enabled me to write clean, maintainable, and testable Java code, and prepared me for real-world software engineering projects in enterprise environments.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA
- Maven
- Git & GitHub
- Postman
- MySQL Workbench

---

## ðŸš€ Projects and Hands-On Work
I applied these skills in building full-stack applications, RESTful services, and performing unit testing using TDD principles. All code was written using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.
