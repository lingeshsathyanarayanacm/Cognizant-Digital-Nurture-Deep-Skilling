## 💻 Backend Development with Spring

- 🌱 **Spring Core & Dependency Injection**  
  Built loosely-coupled, testable components using IoC and DI.

- ⚙️ **Spring Boot 3**  
  Developed RESTful APIs and microservices using Spring Boot’s auto-configuration and embedded server features.

- 🗃️ **Spring Data JPA with Hibernate**  
  Implemented CRUD operations, custom queries, and database interactions seamlessly with ORM.

- 🌐 **Spring REST**  
  Designed and exposed APIs using best practices (status codes, validation, HATEOAS-ready structures).
